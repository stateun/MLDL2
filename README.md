This repository is part of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning 2 course at the _Data Science Graduate School of Seoul National University._

The course is divided into two parts: machine learning and deep learning. This repository contains two assignments completed during the deep learning segment of the course.

Each folder includes the code I submitted along with the approaches and methodologies I used.
